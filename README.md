## Analyzing text with Azure Machine Learning and Cognitive Services


In this workshop, you will help Contoso Ltd., an insurance company, build a proof of concept that shows how they can develop a solution that amplifies their agents' claims processing capabilities. 

This repository provides all the necessary resources for developers, data scientists and citizen developers to deploy the required cloud infrastructure and configure all services involved. Let's have a look at the guides you will work through.


1. [Setup Guide](/Setup%20Guide.md)

This guide will help you to deploy the cloud infrastructure to your Azure Subscription before starting with the hands on configurations. You will find all necessary pre-requisites and instructions to prepare your resource group with computing, data, AI and storage capabilities. 

Remember to plan this deployments ahead of time to allow provisioning delays.


2. [Hands-on-lab step-by-step](/HOL%20step-by%20step%20-%20Analyzing%20text%20with%20Azure%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Cognitive%20Services.md)

Once the resources are up and running, we can proceed with the hands-on-lab. Here we will find the combination of exercises and tasks to configure a fully functioning cloud native application with cognitive capabilities. 

3. Resource folders

In the remaining folders you will find the remaining code and templates to utilize during you hands on deployment.
