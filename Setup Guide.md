## Requirements

1. You will need an Azure subscription with permissions to deploy resource groups and resources into them. 

2. You must be a subscription contributor with the user access administrator role or a subscription owner.

## Setup guide

Duration: 45 minutes 

In this exercise, you set up your environment for use in the rest of the deployment. You should follow all steps provided in the setup guide.

> **Important**: Many Azure resources require globally unique names. Throughout these steps, the word "SUFFIX" appears as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or other value to ensure uniquely named resources. 

### Task 1: Create a resource group
